      <description>My 1st radio contact with the International Space Station Susan Helms was a resident of the International Space Station (ISS) as flight engineer for over five months in 2001. While participating in ISS Expedition 2, she was a very active astronaut in the field of hamradio communications. It was also during Expedition 2 that the amateur radio equipment was installed, allowing us hams to contact the astronauts. You can hear my first conversation with her (recorded on 23rd June 2001).</description>

A multi-point telebridge contact means that each student will be on the telebridge from their own home: the students will be talking with the ISS from their homes over phone lines.</description>
