<p>After my first radio contact with the International Space Station, one that I remember being so special as I was the first Portuguese Ham who accomplished that goal, and because I drove 100km just to go home and then go back to the 24th Juneâ€™s St. Johns Party I was attending, the next day I was lucky enough to be able to offer Susan Helms a box of chocolates.</p>
