      <description>On October 4th 2007 at 00:00 MESZ a balloon was launched from a team of radio amateurs at the Sternwarte Bochum/Germany. This is of course not really a satellite. It carried a beacon with the callsign DA0SPUTNIK which was transmitting information and audio recordings of the first artificial satellite Sputnik-1 which had been launched 50 years before.

      <description>Reception of FSK AX.100 Mode 5 9600 from AISTECHSAT-3 Satellite.
Based on the CubeSat-2U platform, AISTECHSAT-3 was developed by GOMSpace and Aistech. The satellites in this series provide aircraft tracking via an ADS-B receiver. There is also a two-way communication system for sending and receiving automatic information from vessels or remote assets around the world.
