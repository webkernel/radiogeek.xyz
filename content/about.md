RadioGeek is a collaborative website with radio related content.

It is a website open to all those who want to share knowledge, information and documentation related to radiocommunications, with a special focus on satellite communications and manned space missions.

The website structure is simple, based on a folder system, in which each project participant will have a folder with their name. Within each folder each participant can place content for sharing.

Everyone is invited to participate. If you want to join the project, send an email to info at radiogeek.xyz.

Each participant is responsible for the accuracy and veracity of his own published data.
