On October 4th 2007 at 00:00 MESZ a balloon was launched from a team of radio amateurs at the Sternwarte Bochum/Germany. This is of course not really a satellite. It carried a beacon with the callsign DA0SPUTNIK which was transmitting information and audio recordings of the first artificial satellite Sputnik-1 which had been launched 50 years before.
