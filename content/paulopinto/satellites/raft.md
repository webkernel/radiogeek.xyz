RAFT de-orbited on 30 May 2007 after 5 months in space. Here’s an excerpt from Raft’s webpage:

BYE-BYE RAFT: Last packet captured was by PE1ITR at 01:45:10. . Nothing heard on the next USA pass at about 0300z on 30 May 2007. Total mission time for RAFT since the 21 December Launch was about 5 months and 9 days. . During the last 24 hours, the RAFT temperature rose by 30 deg C in the dark. Presumably it was reaching 50C in the day side. . To hear one of the last packet-to-voice messages, recorded by PA3GUO, replay this:

Also there is good information on [PE1ITR’s RAFT web page](http://www.itr-datanet.com/~pe1itr/satellite/raft.htm).  

Listen to one of my QSO’s with PE1ITR in RAFT’s packet-to-voice mode:
