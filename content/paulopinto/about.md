Hi!

My name is Paulo Pinto and my ham callsign is CT1ETE.

I have been passionate about communications since I was 13 years old. I obtained my amateur radio license in 1993 and since then I have been dedicating a large part of my free time to DX, Satellites and SWL.

I am lover of CW (Morse code) and I've been trying to improve the speed of my decoding ability.

I am active in HF / VHF / UHF.

I'm also interested in space communications, astronomy and weather data collection.
