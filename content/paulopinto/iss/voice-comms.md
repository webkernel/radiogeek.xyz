# My 1st radio contact with the International Space Station

Susan Helms was a resident of the International Space Station (ISS) as flight engineer for over five months in 2001. While participating in ISS Expedition 2, she was a very active astronaut in the field of hamradio communications. It was also during Expedition 2 that the amateur radio equipment was installed, allowing us hams to contact the astronauts. You can hear my first conversation with her (recorded on 23rd June 2001).

# I offered Susan Helms a box of chocolates

After my first radio contact with the International Space Station, one that I remember being so special as I was the first Portuguese Ham who accomplished that goal, and because I drove 100km just to go home and then go back to the 24th Juneâ€™s St. Johns Party I was attending, the next day I was lucky enough to be able to offer Susan Helms a box of chocolates.

Frank Culbertson Jr. lived and worked aboard the station for a total of 129 days, and was in command of the station for 117 days.
