# Students in Rio de Janeiro talk to the Space Station

A multi-point telebridge took place today between students of the American School of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and astronaut Chris Cassidy KF5KDR, using OR4ISS callsign, aboard the International Space Station.

A multi-point telebridge contact means that each student will be on the telebridge from their own home: the students will be talking with the ISS from their homes over phone lines.

This is the audio recorded at my @SATNOGS Ground Station.
